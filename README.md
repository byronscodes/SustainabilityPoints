# SustainabilityPoints

This project was made by Team 5 for submission in Marriotte's 2024 CodeFest. The topic was the future of travel and sustainability, so our group made an "Eco-Incentive Program" for hotel guests where if they act in more sustainable ways such as using less water, electricity, or denying housekeeping, they are able to earn Marriote Bonvoy points.

This project was made entirely with Java as it was the OOP programming language that our group knew the best. The program sets up a guest class and the number of days they have stayed in the current calendar year, and for their current trip. After each day, it compares the amount of water or electricity the guest has used in comparison to the average consumption of each resource for the same number of hotel guests, and asks whether they'd like to have housekeeping clean their room that day. These factors contribute to a "sustainability score" that evaluates how many points they earn that day.
